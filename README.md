# Aura+ - A Mental Health Platform for Physically Disabled Individuals

## Introduction
**Aura+** is an innovative mental health platform designed specifically for physically disabled individuals. Our project integrates multiple technologies to provide a seamless and accessible mental health support system. It offers **face authentication login, an AI therapist chatbot, therapy tools, virtual environments, and secure patient record storage using blockchain encryption**.

---

## Features

### 1. Multi-Biometric Authentication (Face Authentication)
- The initial plan was to implement a three-step biometric authentication system using **face recognition, voice authentication, and dynamic text reading**.
- Due to time constraints, only **face authentication** is currently implemented.

### 2. AI Therapist Chatbot
- A chatbot that interacts with users to provide **mental health support**.
- After each conversation, a **log is created and analyzed using NLP**.
- The sentiment of the conversation is visualized on a **dashboard** to indicate signs of **depression, anxiety, and overall mood**.

### 3. Therapy Cards
A dedicated section for **therapeutic activities** such as:
- ðŸ“– Reading motivational content
- ðŸŽ¨ Drawing for self-expression
- ðŸŽµ Listening to calming music

### 4. Contact Therapist Simulation
- A **simulated one-on-one therapy session**
- Includes a basic **sign language to text conversion model**
- Currently supports simple gestures like:
  - âœ‹ Showing all five fingers = **"Hello"**
  - âœŠ Making a fist towards the camera = **"No"**

### 5. Virtual Environment for Awareness
- An interactive **3D space** designed to increase engagement and awareness about mental health.

### 6. Dynamic Mode (3D Interactive Experience)
- A **3D-controlled character** navigates teleport points on the map to **access different features of the platform** interactively.

### 7. Secure Patient Diagnosis & Blockchain Storage
- **Patient records** are stored securely with **encryption**
- Only **hash values** are stored on the **blockchain** to ensure privacy and security while maintaining public accessibility

## Important Notes
* The **sign language recognition model** requires a **well-lit environment**
* The **face authentication system** is currently the only biometric method implemented
* Each component must be run in a separate terminal window to function properly
* Ensure all required ports (6001, 6002, 6003) are available before starting the services

## Future Improvements
* A **more robust sign language model**
* Completion of **multi-biometric authentication**
* Enhanced integration between components
* Expanded therapy tool collection
* Improved virtual environment interactions

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React.js
* Backend: Node.js
* Authentication: Face Recognition API
* Database: Blockchain Technology
* 3D Environment: Three.js
* Video Calls: WebRTC
* AI Chatbot: Natural Language Processing
