# Aura+ - A Mental Health Platform for Physically Disabled Individuals

## Introduction
**Aura+** is an innovative mental health platform designed specifically for physically disabled individuals which brings up a very large number of problems one needs to solve to succesfully solve the issue. Our project integrates multiple technologies to provide a seamless and accessible mental health support system. It offers **face authentication login, an AI therapist chatbot, therapy tools, virtual environments, and secure patient record storage using blockchain encryption**.

## Features

### 0. Main Utility Features
- To allow Physically disabled people there are some main features we had to focus on first like each page when loaded starts an AI generated voice which tells the features of each page
- The Whole webapp's feature are voice enabled which means if someone is physcially disabled they dont have to touch mouse or keyboard then can just say "Hey Aura!" and the feature like "Get Started" and the page wil load.
- The whole webapp is multilingual with the help of a smart Google Translator integration which allows the app to display its content in any language.

### 1. Multi-Biometric Authentication (Face Authentication)
- The initial plan was to implement a three-step biometric authentication system using **face recognition, voice authentication, and dynamic text reading**.
- Due to time constraints, only **face authentication** is currently implemented.

### 2. AI Therapist Chatbot
- A chatbot that interacts with users to provide **mental health support**.
- After each conversation, a **log is created and analyzed using NLP**.
- The sentiment of the conversation is visualized on a **dashboard** to indicate signs of **depression, anxiety, and overall mood**.

### 6. Patient Record System using BlockChain
**Terminal 8:**
## Blockchain-Based EHR Framework

###  Note: This is the last step come to it after following all the steps given above else the application will run in some other port.

## Overview
This framework aims to leverage **blockchain technology** for **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** with a focus on **secure storage and granular access control**. Additionally, it addresses the **scalability issue** commonly faced by blockchain systems by implementing **off-chain storage**. The framework provides a **scalable, secure, and integral blockchain-based EHR solution**.

## Features
- **Blockchain-based EHR storage**
- **Granular access control for users**
- **Off-chain storage for scalability**
- **Secure and decentralized data management**

## Deploying the Smart Contract
### 1. Install Truffle (in app directory)
```sh
npm install -g truffle
```

### 2. Compile Smart Contracts
```sh
truffle compile
```

### 3. Start Local Development Blockchain

```sh
truffle migrate
```
- Copy the deployed contract address and update it in `src/app.js`:
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/581b3857-283c-4c14-8ae1-fab0776822da)

```js
// app/src/app.js (Line 11)
var agentContractAddress = '0x75E115394aacC7c6063E593B9292CB9417E4cbeC';
```
- If you change contract contents, **reset deployment**:
```sh
truffle migrate --reset
```
**Note:** Resetting will change the contract address, so update `src/app.js` accordingly.

* The **face authentication system** is currently the only biometric method implemented
* Each component must be run in a separate terminal window to function properly
* Ensure all required ports (6001, 6002, 6003) are available before starting the services

## Future Improvements
* A **more robust sign language model**
* Completion of **multi-biometric authentication**
* Enhanced integration between components
* Expanded therapy tool collection
* Improved virtual environment interactions

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React.js
* Backend: Node.js
* Authentication: Face Recognition API
* Database: Blockchain Technology
* 3D Environment: Three.js
